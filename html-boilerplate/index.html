        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>This is my first webpage. Here we go with practice</h2>

        <p>
            I will use this website for storing <strong>recipes</strong> because
            I hate printing out recipes. Printers are the <em>worst</em> piece of technology
            we are still forced to use.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020290-one-pot-pasta-with-ricotta-and-lemon">NYTimes - One Pot Pasta with Ricotta and Lemon</a></li>

        <h3>Theater Audition App</h3>
        <p>
            I also have an idea for an app for the theater community which is basically
            LinkedIn but for theater. Actors still have to <em>print</em> out resumes, headshots
            and other documentation for auditions. There should be an app to
            connect an actor's audition recording to their supporting documentation for a show.
            It should be easy for directors to reference audition materials and make
            casting decisions. It should be easier for actors to maintain a resume
            and headshots.
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>This app will store resume information and headshots for actors.</li>
                <li>This app will store a calendar of upcoming auditions with supporting details like role descriptions.</li>
                <li>This app will store videos of auditions with associated documentation using a QR code scanner.</li>
                <li>This app will make it easy for directors to access auditions in the past.</li>
            </ul>
