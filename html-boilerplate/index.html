            I will use this website for storing <strong>recipes</strong> because
            I hate printing out recipes. Printers are the <em>worst</em> piece of technology
            we are still forced to use.

            I also have an idea for an app for the theater community which is basically
            LinkedIn but for theater. Actors still have to <em>print</em> out resumes, headshots
            and other documentation for auditions. There should be an app to
            connect an actor's audition recording to their supporting documentation for a show.
            It should be easy for directors to reference audition materials and make
            casting decisions. It should be easier for actors to maintain a resume
            and headshots.
