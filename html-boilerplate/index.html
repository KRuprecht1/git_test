        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>This is my first webpage. Here we go with practice</h2>

        <p>
            I will use this website for storing <strong>recipes</strong> because
            I hate printing out recipes. Printers are the <em>worst</em> piece of technology
            we are still forced to use.
        </p>

        <h3>Theater Audition App</h3>
        <p>
            I also have an idea for an app for the theater community which is basically
            LinkedIn but for theater. Actors still have to <em>print</em> out resumes, headshots
            and other documentation for auditions. There should be an app to
            connect an actor's audition recording to their supporting documentation for a show.
            It should be easy for directors to reference audition materials and make
            casting decisions. It should be easier for actors to maintain a resume
            and headshots.
        </p>

        <p>
            This app will store resume information and headshots for actors.
            This app will store a calendar of upcoming auditions with supporting details like role descriptions.
            This app will store videos of auditions with associated documentation using a QR code scanner.
            This app will make it easy for directors to access auditions in the past.
